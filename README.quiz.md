# ArcFusion Take-Home Assignment: Frontend

## Objective

Build a production-ready frontend application that enables users to upload PDFs and ask questions about their content via an API. The focus is on component architecture, state management, styling, and frontend code quality â€” not on the LLM or AI logic itself. The chat response from the backend will be mocked. You are expected to only do frontend development.

## Requirements

Frontend Stack

- React (with TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS (Shadcn, Radix UI, or custom components)
- State Management: Your choice (Zustand, Redux, React Context)
- Component Design: Reusable, documented, scalable

## Core Features

- PDF Upload UI
- Allow users to upload one or more PDF files
- Display uploaded filenames in a list
- Chat-like Q&A Interface
- Input field for user to ask questions
- Display of question/answer pairs
- Simulate real-time feedback (loading indicators)
- Session Management
- "Reset" button to clear current chat session
- Memory Indicator
- Show whether the current session has memory (e.g., simple badge or toggle)

## Bonus Points

- Component-driven development (with Storybook)
- Theme toggle (dark/light mode)
- Responsive design across mobile/tablet/desktop
- Accessibility (WAI-ARIA)
- Visual regression testing setup (Chromatic or similar)
- Websocket integration for chat api

## Deliverables

Git Repository

- Source code
- Component folder structure clearly organized
- Docker + docker-compose setup for easy run

README.md containing:

- How to run it locally using `docker-compose.yml`
- Project structure and component breakdown
- Any tradeoffs or assumptions made
- What you would do to improve in a real-world scenario
  Optional: Short Loom/video walkthrough explaining the project

## What We're Evaluating

Category What We Look For

- Architecture Well-structured, maintainable codebase
- Component Design Reusability, isolation, and clarity
- State Management Clean, scalable handling of UI and app state
- API Integration Clean, decoupled service layer or hooks
- Styling & Theming Tailwind conventions, consistent visual system
- Code Quality TypeScript use, folder structure, code readability
- UX Attention Thoughtful interactions, loading/error handling
- Ownership Mindset README clarity, polish, and documentation

## Backend Setup (For Candidates)

A FastAPI backend has been provided for this take-home test. Follow these steps to set it up:

### Using Docker

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build

# The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
# API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Available Endpoints

#### Core Functionality

- **POST** `/api/upload` - Upload PDF files
- **POST** `/api/chat` - Ask questions about uploaded documents
- **POST** `/api/reset` - Reset chat session and clear memory
- **WebSocket** `/api/ws/chat` - Streaming chat interface

#### Chat Management

- **POST** `/api/chat/create` - Create new chat session
- **GET** `/api/chat/{chat_id}` - Get chat history for specific chat ID
- **GET** `/api/chat` - Get summary of all chat sessions

#### Dashboard & Info

- **GET** `/api/files` - Get all uploaded files information
- **GET** `/api/status` - Get session status
- **GET** `/health` - Health check

### API Documentation

Once the backend is running, visit:

- Interactive API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Alternative docs: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Frontend Integration

The backend is configured to work with frontend applications.
Visit the docs for more detailed response schemas.

```javascript
// Upload files
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("files", pdfFile);
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});

// Chat
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ question: "What is this document about?" }),
});

// WebSocket streaming
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/api/ws/chat");
ws.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    question: "Your question here",
    chat_id: "optional-chat-id",
  })
);

// Create new chat session
const newChat = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/chat/create", {
  method: "POST",
});
const { chat_id } = await newChat.json();

// Get chat history
const chatHistory = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/chat/${chat_id}`);
const history = await chatHistory.json();

// Get all chats summary
const allChats = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/chat");
const chatsData = await allChats.json();

// Get uploaded files info
const files = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/files");
const filesData = await files.json();
```
